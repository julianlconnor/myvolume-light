# (myvolu.me)[http://myvolu.me]

Side project of mine that replicates my most tried and true strategy of finding new music that fits my tastes.

Simple client side JS app that allows you to quickly iterate through beatport charts whilst previewing tracks. Myvolu.me will dynamically generate download links for the tracks that tickle your fancy.
